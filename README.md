# Comp 225 Project using Phaser 3 Webpack Project Template
# WIP


After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm start`.

After starting the development server with `npm start`, you can edit any files in the `src` folder and webpack will automatically recompile and reload your server (available at `http://localhost:8080` by default).
