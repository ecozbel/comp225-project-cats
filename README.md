# INTRODUCTION

Software Design and Development (COMP 225) semester long project;

Cats with Jobs is a web application developed with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and the Phaser game framework. Through this calming, narrative based dress up game, you pick a Cat Pal and your job is to help them get ready for their day. Each resident comes with a story, but your Cat Pal's looks for the day are ultimately up to you. Memories of the last ten Cat Pals you have helped will be stored in a gallery.

# COMPATIBILITY

Cats with Jobs is currently compatible with browsers Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. 


# SETUP

Node.js is required to install dependencies and run scripts via npm.

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm start`.

After starting the development server with `npm start`, you can edit any files in the `src` folder and webpack will automatically recompile and reload your server (available at `http://localhost:8080` by default).

If you want to customize your build like we did, like adding a new webpack loader or plugin (i.e. for loading CSS or fonts), you can modify the webpack/base.js file for cross-project changes, or you can modify and/or create new configuration files and target them in specific npm tasks inside of `package.json'.


# AVAILABLE COMMANDS

npm install - Install project dependencies

npm start - Build project and open web server running project

npm run build - Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc..)
