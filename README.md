# Comp 225 Project using Phaser 3 Webpack Project Template
# WIP

"Welcome to Cat Town! In Cats with Jobs, you get assigned a Cat Pal and your job is to help them get ready for their day. Each resident comes with a story, but your Cat Pal's looks for the day are ultimately up to you. Memories of the last ten Cat Pals you have helped will be stored in the gallery. Original artwork and music created by Ceyhun, Ifraah, Nawal and Jarett. With thanks to Richard Davey's phaser template."




After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm start`.

After starting the development server with `npm start`, you can edit any files in the `src` folder and webpack will automatically recompile and reload your server (available at `http://localhost:8080` by default).
